# Genzy Coin Core integration/staging repository

Genzy Coin is an open source crypto-currency focused on fast private transactions with low transaction fees & environmental footprint.  It utilizes a custom Proof of Stake protocol for securing its network and uses an innovative variable seesaw reward mechanism that dynamically balances 90% of its block reward size between masternodes and staking nodes and 10% dedicated for budget proposals. The goal of Genzy Coin is to achieve a decentralized sustainable crypto currency with near instant full-time private transactions, fair governance and community intelligence.
